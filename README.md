## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’»

Even though Iâ€™ve built a successful career in design engineering for automotive interiors, my passion for blockchain technology has led me down this new and exciting path. Having a foundation in programming from my high school and university days and a curiosity for blockchain, Iâ€™ve been researching this field through books and online courses on Ethereum, Solidity and Smart Contracts. This exploration turned into hands-on development, starting with personal projects like an ERC20 token contract with a functional faucet and an ERC721 NFT minting platform. 
As I am continuing the development of my portfolio, I am also looking forward to opportunities that will allow me to collaborate with experienced blockchain professionals. Whether its entry-level roles or connecting with like-minded individuals, Iâ€™m eager to contribute to real-world projects, expand my knowledge, and grow in the blockchain space.
