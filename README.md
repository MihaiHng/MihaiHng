## Hi there 👋

💻

I’m passionate about blockchain and have been exploring the space through hands-on smart contract development. With a foundation in programming from my early education, I’ve developed my understanding through books and online courses focused on Ethereum, Solidity, and the EVM.

My latest projects, helped me navigate the full development cycle of smart contracts—from writing and testing, gas optimization, security guidelines to deploying on EVM-compatible networks, while learning to write well documented, readable and maintainable code.

As I continue building out my portfolio, I’m eager to contribute to real-world projects and grow within the web3 ecosystem. I'm actively looking for entry-level opportunities or open-source collaborations where I can add value and continue learning.
